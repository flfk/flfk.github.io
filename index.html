          <h5>Green Eats is an app to help you track your food related emissions</h3>
          <p>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. To remain within our planet’s boundaries, we must make a transition to more sustainable choices in all areas of life.</p>
          <p>The food we eat is one of these areas. Food related emissions make up around 18% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Their source is varied. Agricultural practices like farming animals which release significant amounts of methane is one example. Deforestation for farming is another.</p>
          <p>Different food choices have different resource requirements. This app gives you the ability to explore the emissions required to produce each of your meals. You can then explore how different choices would affect your environmental footprint.</p>
          <p>GreenEats doesn’t tell you what to eat but it does give you information. You can now make choices that could reduce your own emissions by 15% without having to dramatically change your lifestyle, hope that the government passes suitable legislation or pressure corporations into making better decisions. For now, this small changes is one of the most effective ways to transition to a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
          <p>An important point to keep in mind is that attributing emissions to food is difficult. How do you keep track of how long your food has been stored for and the associated refrigeration emissions? How much of the emissions associated with driving a truck is attributed to, say, a single apple? How do you convert emissions of different greenhouse gases to the same units?</p>
          <p>Most likely, as you use the app the patterns will become obvious and you’ll develop an intuitive feel for the impact of your choices. At this point you might even stop using GreenEats because you’ll know the rough answer already and plugging the ingredients in won’t give you any more information. You might check back occasionally when you’re not sure but for the most part you’ll just know. This is the ideal result of using GreenEats.</p>
